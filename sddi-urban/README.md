<h1 align="center">SDDI CKAN Docker, additional image sddi-urban</h1>

This directory provides an additional [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan) Docker image for the
[`sddi-ckan-k8s`](https://github.com/tum-gis/sddi-ckan-k8s) Helm chart.
The images contain CKAN itself compiled with a set of CKAN extension to add functionality required for
the SDDI concept and beyond that.

## :inbox_tray: Image flavor overview

The CKAN-SDDI Docker images are originally released in different flavors, that are described in the 
[Readme](https://github.com/tum-gis/sddi-ckan-k8s). With `sddi-base`, another flavor is added. 
For each flavor a one [package](https://github.com/orgs/tum-gis/packages?repo_name=ckan-docker)
exists in this repository, where the image can be pulled.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-urban

```

### `sddi-urban`

`sddi-base` + some CKAN extensions for extended data and resource preview and description options,
extended import-/ export, harvesting, and security support. Some extensions from `sddi-base`
are installed but deactivated. These could be easily reactivated by including them into the
plugin list in ckan configuration.
This image also includes a slightly different set of preinstalled SDDI groups and topics as
well as the option of custom theming and custom metadata schemas, inspired by the requirements
of Landeshauptstadt München (LHM).

## :1234: Image versioning

The images in this repo are versioned and tagged according to the
[releases](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/releases) of this repository.
The `latest` tag points to the latest release number. The `edge` version is built from the
latest commit to the `main` branch of this repo.

All available tags are listed in the packages of each image:

- [`sddi-urban`](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckan-docker/pkgs/container/ckan-sddi-urban)

### CKAN and CKAN extension versions

CKAN version: `2.9.9`
CKAN base image: `ghcr.io/keitaroinc/ckan:2.9.9-focal`

The CKAN catalog platform uses several extensions to provide the functionality
needed for the SDDI concept. The table below lists the included extensions with
the currently used version. Depending of the version of the upstream repository
of the individual extensions, the version refers either to a *release version*
or *commit hash*.

To ensure stable versioning for the images, the versions in the `Dockerfiles`
are alway pinned to a stable release number or commit hash.

> **Note:** Version pinning is only applied for release versions. The `edge`
> image may depend on upstream branches instead.
